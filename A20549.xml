            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It is the vſuall courſe and cuſtome of the Scripture to intimate neceſſary duties by prayſing their wiſedome which carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, and cenſuring their folly which negligently omitte them. As the wiſe builder layeth his foundation on the rocke, and<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 26</note> the fooliſh on the ſand.

And why is the other called prudent? becauſe he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the way of wiſedome, and ſhall accordingly inioye the welfare of the wiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the authority is ſo ample, and amiable, as that in euery <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> reſpect, it challengeth duety at the childs hand without gaineſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Who beſides ſuch as are brutiſh, and voyde of all humanity, would except againſt his fathers admonitions, and ſay, you ſpeak from malice, I take you not for my friend, you beare me no good will? Who, without extreame, and barbarous arrogancy, nay groſe and moſt ſhameful diſloialty, can ſay vnto him, you haue nothing to doe with me, meddle with them that belong vnto you, I am too good to learne at your hands, and you are too baſe to be my commander? Fatherhood containeth loue, and greatneſſe, and whatſoeuer may either allure the child to ſubiection, or compell him to ſubmiſſion. The gouernment of the greateſt maſters is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commendable, when they deale as parents: the gouernment of the mightieſt Princes is then renowmed, when it is paternall, and the ſubiects are vſed like ſonnes: the gouernment of the high God of heauen is therefore moſt glorious, becauſe it is fatherly, and gracious, and all his people are alſo become his children.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the leſſons of godly parents be very forcible, when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they be duely imbraced of obedient children. Their inſtructions and praiers ioyne together: their tongues and hearts go together: and their exhortations and Gods bleſſing worke togeather for good effect and profite. And by this meanes are many prepared to liue as holy Chriſtians, vnder the miniſter in the Church: and as faithfull ſubiects. vnder the magiſtrate in the common weale: and as fruitfull perſons for themſelues and others, in their ſeuerall callings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the perill of contemptuous children is ſo great, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their puniſhment ſhall be ſo grieuous, as that happy is euery one that auoydeth that their ſinne. <hi>The eie that mocketh his father, or</hi>

Now though it be true, that many of them eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this ignominious end here, yet neither is this a wiſh without ſucceſſe, nor a threatning without execution. Though their bodies come not at the gibbet, yet if their ſoules go to hell, what are they the better for being buried, as the rich man was? <hi>Luke</hi> 16. Though their fleſh, and eies be not deuoured of Rauens and Eagles, yet if their ſoules and bodies be an euerlaſting pray to eternall death, how much is their miſery abated?</p>

Jt is a ſufficient motiue to make thee attentiue to thy fathers words, if there be any equity in them, becauſe he is thy father. When he only commandeth for himſelfe he is to be heard, and obeyed, ſithence thou canſt not performe ſo much vnto him, as he hath deſerued at thine hands. He was the inſtrument of thy life and being he was by conſequence the meanes and occaſion of all the happineſſe which euer thou ſhalt enioy. Much more reſpect then is to be had of his ſpeaches which proceed from his meere loue, and kindneſſe to thee: which wholly tend to thy profit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite: which God hath ſent by him in mercy, for the good of thy ſoule and body, preſent, and euerlaſting. When the Lord opened the mouth of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, onely to reproue <hi>Balaams</hi> fooliſhnes, it was <hi>Balaams</hi> great fault and folly, that he tooke no more heed to that which was ſpoken to him, and therefore when he chuſeth ſo honorable a meſſenger, as is the parent to the child, and not ſo much to reproue, as to direct and aſſiſt him, what regard ought to be had of his admonitions?</p>

They gape for his goods, and long for his liuings, &amp; greedily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet after their patrimony: but they reiect his goodnes, and loath his graces, and will haue no portion of his wiſedome. If their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Will they autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize them to be commanders for the ſeruice of ſinne, &amp; diſclaim their iuriſdiction when they deale for the Lord? Let them know (for in time they are like to feele it) that this contempt is the forerunner of ſome iudgement. Though the father happily can not puniſh them, yet God is able; though the father would pardon them, yet the Lord will plague them. <hi>Eli</hi> was more willing to haue his admonitions neglected, then his ſonnes to be deſtroied, but God would not ſuffer them ſo to eſcape, and therefore it is ſayd, <hi>That they obeied not the voice of their Father, becauſe the</hi>

Such ſinfull perſons yet may be ſayd to keepe their mouthes, though not as our Text doth admoniſh vs, by ſhutting them vp againſt all vnlawfull diſcourſes, but as musketours hauing them alwayes churged, with ſome impious, falſe, and corrupt matter, and leuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling euery where at ſuch as they minde to infect or depraue by them.

This cauſe ariſeth from their owne ſinfull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but an other proceedeth from Gods iuſt iudgement vpon them. jf they luſted, and obtained that which they wiſhed for, it would be a pleaſure to them: though they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that which they deſired not, they would not greatly feele it: but now that they are ſo hungry for wealth, and yet kept faſting from it, when they ſee others ſo ſtored with plenty, this is a ſtroake of the Lords owne hand, as a puniſhment of their ſinne, and addition to their miſery.

               <p>Secondly, this is manifeſt by the effects of it: for who will vſe ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> many ſhifts and deuiſes to come by goods, as ſlothfull men vſe to doe. They will pawne and forſet all their credit to get any mans money by borrowing. They will aduenture all their ſtate to winn away mens mony by gaming. And in that caſe they ſpare not any friend, either kinſman or brother, either ſuch as feaſt them, or

They will hazard their liues to wreſt and extort away mens mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by robbery, and filch away their cattell by ſtealing: doth not this declare a violent affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hauing, when they ſtraine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo far to get ſubſtance?</p>
               <p>Confutation of them that charge none but rich men with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, as if it were impoſſible for any to affect wealth, that <label type="milestone">

All vnthrifty perſons ſhould be acquited of that ſin, and euery one that is faithfull in his caling and proſperous in his ſtate, ſhould be condemned thereof, if God would allow of their verdit. But he hath not empannelled them vpon the iury, they may iuſtly be challenged for partiality, and being parties, neither ſpeake they according to law, nor yet haue any ſufficient euidence for the facts: for the Lord himſelfe teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſuch as get little, be deſirous of much, and they that haue nothing, by their wills would haue all.</p>
               <p>Inſtruction, that we be not ſluggards in ſpirituall things, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelues with wiſhing for grace and ſaluation without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> labour and trauaile for them. <hi>Striue</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>to enter in at the ſtraite gate: for manie I ſay vnto you, will ſeeke to enter in,</hi>

               <p>The affections are of as great force in the ſeruices of God, as the words and actions, and the heart hath no leſſe place then the members of the body.

               <p>Firſt, the one ſheweth his pride, and lifteth vp himſelfe, when <label type="milestone">

They are like to quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites ouergrowne with greene graſſe, wherein is no appearance of perill, before a man be plunged in them.

               <p>The third is contempt and diſdaine, when they conceiue a baſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> opinion of their brethren, as of vnworthy and vile perſons, and feare not to loade them with deſpite and contumelies, or to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect all manner of duty towards them.</p>
               <p>The fourth is ambition, when they ſtriue for victory, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to themſelues praiſe, or ſeeke like <hi>Lamech</hi> to be feared for<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 23.</note> their force and boyſterouſnes.</p>
               <p>Reproofe of them that being moſt vnquiet and troubleſome, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> do caſt all the blame vpon them that beare all the burden. None barke ſo much with their tongues, as they that bite moſt with their teeth; none calumniate ſo much with lips of falſhood, as they that ſmite with the fiſts of iniquity: the wrong doers are the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt fault-finders; and they that are iniuriouſly oppreſſed, are commonly alſo maliciouſly depraued. How many exclaime of euil neighbors, that they cannot liue peaceably amongſt them, and will not looke to the pride of their owne harts, which breedeth the contentions? Whereſoeuer they dwell they are daſhed with waues of ſtrife and diſſenſion, and then they accuſe the times, and places, and people, when they themſelues excite the tempeſt, and cary in their boſomes the blaſts that raiſe the billowes.</p>
               <p>Confutation of them that thinke none to be proude, but ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as are pompous, and that none can haue great hearts, that be not clad with gorgeous apparell. They that are to exerciſe their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery among the vulgar and poorer ſort, ſhall find it a difficult matter to conuince them of the ſin of pride. It ſeemeth a ſtrange paradox vnto them, and a palpable wrong and indignity offered
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26773:17"/> to tax them with ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that, as though it were impoſſible for them to be touched with it, ſithence their garments and houſes and furniture, and all doe apparantly ſhew the contrary. But how doe they demeane themſelues? what agreement haue they with their neighbours? Indeede they cannot deny, but that there is great diſcord between them and other without dores, the whole towne is at variance with them, and within dores they cannot but fall out with the whole houſhold: for there is none abroade or at home which doth not abuſe them. Who ſeeth not a high mind in alow ſtate, and much pride in ſmall wealth, and a great ſtomacke vnder ragged rayment?</p>
               <p>Inſtruction if we would ſhew our mildnes, and not vexe our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſelues and others with brawles and contentions, let vs purge our hearts of this turbulent humour, which is a perpetuall make-bate.

               <p>Secondly, they well diſcerne that they ſhall gaine nothing by the loſſe that they cauſe other men to ſuſtaine: their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours infamy will not heale their credite: and the trouble that

               <p>Thirdly, they foreſee and ponder of the perills that may growe to themſelues by vnneceſſary contentions. Should they not vexe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their minds by diſtempers, and perturbations? Should they not hinder their ſtate by expences and charges? Should they not get themſelues enemies ſiding and diuiſion? Should they not indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger themſelues of ſhame and ignominy by taking the foyle, and being ouerthrowne in the ſuit? All theſe they looke into before they enter into the ſtrife, and therefore in conſideration of them, they forbeare to ſtriue at all.</p>
               <p>Reprofe of them that take it to be the beſt meanes for making <label type="milestone">

                  </label> their wiſedom notyfied, and known to the world, to be ſtirring and ready to purſue euery quarrell. It ſeemeth to them a title of honour to be ſayd to haue a ſhrewd head, and therfore they make themſelues maſters of moleſtation, that few can liue in peace and quietnes by them. But if Chriſt Ieſus was wiſe (as who can deny him to be very wiſedome it ſelfe) then theſe are neceſſarily to be accounted fooles, as taking a courſe directly contrary to his. For he eſteemed it as a matter of true praiſe to be meeke and gentle as a lamb, receiuing many wrongs rather then reuenging one; but they glory in being like to bulles and Rams, and fiercer beaſts, that offer violence to ſuch as neuer prouoked them with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, they caſt from them all the remedies and medicines, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whereby they might be cured of their ſins, and deliuered from

Howſoeuer they pretend to ſtand for ſincerity, yet they reſiſt it: and taking vpon them to be champions for Chriſt his kingdome, they fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: and though their arguments ſeeme to be grounded on the word, yet being well ſifted they proue meere falacyes, &amp; haue no agreement with the meaning of the Holy ghoſt, in the word.

He ſhall rather loſe his ſeruice, then they will loſe their ſinfull pleaſures: his lawes ſhall rather be tranſgreſſed, then ought of their commodities leſſened: they care not how low his glory falleth, ſo that their name and credit may mount vp aloft.

               <p>THough the meaning of theſe words hath been ſhewed, and proſecuted already in the eleuenth verſe of the tenth chapter, yet we will adde ſomewhat to the explication thereof.

And yet further to theſe muſt be added of his part that will drinke of this liuely fountaine, an attentiue eare, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing heart to heare and imbrace the doctrine. And then it will be conſtant and not dryed vp like ditches or ponds that are fed with raine water: it will be comfortable, and refreſh the hearts
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26773:22"/> of them that are in affliction: it will be profitable, and make them that receiue it, fruitfull: it will be neceſſary and forcible to deliuer them from ſinne and deſtruction, though therein the ſimilitude be altered: for that is meant by turning from the ſnares of death.</p>
               <p>

Experience and the holy Scriptures haue made all ſucceeding ages &amp; nations to know that their words were true, and ſo confirmed, and the others falſe, and ſo confuted; they were preſently incouraged by Gods fauour and promiſe; and the other terrified by his anger and threatning: it was to them according to their faith; for they entred and dwelt in the promiſed land, and it<note place="margin">Numb. 14. 37. 38.</note> came to the other according to their vnbeliefe; for they were all deſtroied by a plague, and periſhed in the wildernes.</p>

And it is meet that theſe ſhould be accompanied with boldnes, that they which haue a good cauſe committed vnto them, ſhould manage it with an vndanted courage, againſt frownings and threatnings, and all manner of impediments and perill. And now ſpeedineſſe may and ought to come into the number, when wiſedome is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to put raſhneſſe back: for lingring and delay is vſually verie dangerous and hurtfull, and ſome be in as great fault for doing their duety too late, as others be for practiſing euill too ſoone.

               <p>THis ſentence dependeth vpon the verſe aforegoing, where the promiſe in the later clauſe of that, is amplified by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the former of this: for there it is ſaid, that <hi>he which regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth correction</hi> ſhall be honoured, and here it is added, that when ſuch a deſirable gift is beſtowed, hee ſhall haue ioy with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which obtaineth it.

               <p>Firſt, this may be ſeene by their demeanour towards ſuch as would draw them out of their iniquities, and perſwade them to holy and Chriſtian conuerſation.

               <p>Thirdly this cauſeth reformation of life to be ſo much diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> becauſe it is ſo little, exerciſed: they which will enter into that way, muſt trauell almoſt ſolitary, hauing fewe companions to go along with them.

When mention was made of diſgrace offered to their diueliſh idole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,<note place="margin">Act 19.</note> they came running together, on an hurry, and bellowing for her, like a tumultuous droue of Oxen.</p>
               <p>Mens waies can neuer bee good, whiles their heart is without

As therefore it commeth to paſſe, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny looſe their labour in attempting impoſſibilities, in ſeeking to drawe vp a ſappe of knowledge and wiſedome, our of the roote of ignorance &amp; folly. They would haue their people to be at their back, ready to forbeare euery euill which they forbid, &amp; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all the duties which they require, and yet not to meddle with religion, or haue any dealing with ſermons or Scripture. So they would haue their words obeyed, and Gods reſiſted: ſo they would haue their owne willes ſatiſfied, rather then the ſoules of the parties ſaued; but ſo they ſhall find themſelues croſſed, and their commandements vtterly contemned. And beſides this, wee may learne to looke for ſtrong encounters when wee aſſault the holes of Satan, and ſtrike at ſinne, we muſt prepare for a ſharpe conflict, a ſhort skirmiſh and bickering will not ſuffice to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh him.

Such as are truely religious do eſteeme it a greater gaine to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſoules to God, and increaſe to the Church and grace to their brethren, than to get wealth and promotion to their owne ſelues. And the wicked on the contrary part are no leſſe buſie then they, though not ſo well occupied: for they beſtir themſelues about their maſters worke, to corrupt all that haue fellowſhip with them, and to draw as many as they can poſſibly, into their felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It is noted in diuers that are infected with the peſtilence, or other foule diſeaſes, that they are very deſirous to infect their neighbours: and ſo is euery one that hath the plague ſore of ſinne running vpon him, he wiſheth (and would worke it alſo, if it lay in his power) that all the world were ouerwhelmed with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our Sauiour condemning the notable wickednes of the ſinfull Phariſies, doth charge this vpon them as one marke of vngratious miſcreants, that they <hi>would compaſſe ſea and land to make one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelite:</hi>

That which they ſay is very forcible to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the mind, and quicken the heart: and that which they do is of great importance as a preſident for their actions, and a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for their waies. The brightneſſe of their ſhining vertues doth make them better ſighted, which ſee them with good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: and the looking vpon ſuch examples, is a meanes to make the beholders like vnto them.

Oh, how many waies, and by what degrees doth miſchiefe and ruine growe to them which haunt their company? The vſe of hearing of lewd or blaſphemous ſpeeches doth quickly quench zeale, and make them ſeeme to be nothing affenſiue. The cuſtome of ſeeing of abhominable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, doth quell their hatred of them, that they can be lookers on without diſlike. And ſo from the eare in time commeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion to the tongue: and from the eye infection proceedeth to the hand, that that which they heare they will ſpeake, and that which they ſee they will doe. Moreouer though there were in them before, ſome good opinion of godly men, and Chriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, yet when they ſhall dayly heare them ſpoken againſt, and ieſted at, and none to refute the ſlanders, or reproue the ſcoffing, it will at length eſtrange, and vtterly alienate their affection from them. When a brand is taken out of the fire, and caſt into the ſnow or raine, it cannot but be extinguiſhed at laſt, though it bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed much at the firſt.

               <p>The vngodly hath the burden layd vpon him, to bring goods together, and the righteous hath the prerogatiue giuen vnto him, to vſe them. And it is not a new faſhion taken vp of late, for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to worke for the ſeruants of God, but it hath been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, time out of mind in former ages. The Egiptians tooke great paines to ſowe and reape and prepare corne, for <hi>Iacob</hi> and his family, and were themſelues pinched with great penury, whiles he and his houſhold were plentifully repleniſhed with it. The Canaanites built houſes for the Iſraelites to dwell in: and planted vineyards for the Iſraelites to eate the fruit of: and digged wells for the Iſraelites to drinke the water of: and prepared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleaſant things for the Iſraelites to haue the inioyment of. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it a caſe peculiar to them, as though it had been an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent not ſeen before, nor like to fall out againe afterwards, but <hi>Iob</hi> declareth it to be a iudgement due to all wicked worldlings, and ordinarily inflicted vpon them, vnleſſe there be a commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, for ſome other more grieuous puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

They feele want of knowledge in their minds, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in their affections: they are priuy to them ſelues of duties neglected, or negligently performed: they finde a guiltines in regard of ſundry ſinnes committed, and of diuers not ſoundly auoided: they ſee ſtill in their nature a pronenes to pride, and many vanities, but no aptnes to that which is good and needefull to be exerciſed. All theſe things trouble their harts, &amp; make them very ſuſpicious of themſelues, leaſt all their piety bee nothing but an outward profeſſion, and all their former comforts but meerly illuſions. But are they deſirous vnpartialie to keepe euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, if there power were anſwerable to their will?

But will you haue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be referred to God himſelf, as it muſt be whatſoeuer your will is? And will you ſtand to his ſentence therein, as you ſhall bee compelled, though it bee againſt your wills? Then heare what he pronounceth of you that he which is lewd in his waies, deſpiſeth him, nay yet more for the greater aggrauation of the ſinne that hee is a deſpiſer, or deſpiſing of him, which is more emphaticall, and imployeth an habite, &amp; accuſtomable practiſe, and profeſſed contempt. You imagine that men are too ſharpe in their cenſures, and condemnings: you ſhall feele vnleſſe you repent, that the Lord will bee farre more ſeuere in this ſentence, with the execution of it. You will ſweare, and blaſpheme the name of God, if it be but to anger them that like not of it you will vſe wanton &amp; ſinfull exerciſes on the Lords day, in deſpig it of thoſe that bee grieued at it: You will proceede on your owne wayes, and vilifie all ſuch as ſhall reprooue you for it: but whom in the meane time, doe you contemne? and whome haue ye ſought to reproch?

But for thoſe that ſinne not ſo preſumptuouſly, nor with ſuch an high hand, if that they be in the power of ſinne and without repentance, this point is very vncomfortable. They dreame that the Lord is not ſo much offended with them, and their behauiour, as they heare ſpoken in ſermons, but that he will lightly paſſe by thoſe things which heere are counted great matters: but let them know that he is more righteous then man, and hateth euery ſinne more then all men hate all ſins. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer through Chriſt, he paſſe by the infirmities of the godly, &amp; taketh things at the beſt, which they doe, yet hee dealeth not ſo with the wicked beeing his enemies, but iudgeth of their waies according to the nature, and effects, and conſequents of the

As he will doe them no wrong to make their faults more or more grieuous then they are: ſo hee will ſhew them no fauour to extenuate their ſinnes, or mittigate the puniſhment which they deſerue.

If the outward ſtate of many ſcorners be reſpected, yet nothing but miſchiefe &amp; miſery inſueth vpon it, if the ſtate of their ſoules be conſidered, they all loſe all their labour, and returne fruſtrate &amp; diſappointed, when other of meaner place, and naturall partes haue happy &amp; proſperous ſucceſſe: they are reiected of the Lord, as contemptible perſons, and abiects, when others whome they deſpiſe, are graced with his preſence &amp; countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: they are ſhut out of dores, &amp; excluded from all ſpiritual co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom they maligne, are let into Gods treaſurie, and ſtored with all heauenly riches. They therfore that are tending towards it, let them ſtay themſelues before they go too far: they that are come to the gate thereof, let them beware how they enter in: they that are already in the houſe, yet let them returne back againe, and not ſitte downe in the chaire: for then their caſe is deſperate. And this is not one lie to admoniſh men that they become not ſcorners, but that alſo they ſatiſfie not themſelues with euery ſlight and ſuperficiall ſeeking of wiſedome. It is not ynough to ſeeke, (for the worſt men, we ſee, may do that) but to ſeeke ſo as we may finde, which none can doe but they that are good and godly. A greater bleſſing God giueth to none in this world, than to make his ordinances forcible to them for wiſedome, and comfort: and a greater iudgement is not executed vpon any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their going to hell, than the withholding from them grace &amp; vnderſtanding.

Many are the promiſes which to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are made by God, and manifold are the profeſſions which holy men make of their confidence therein, both in the old and new teſtament.
